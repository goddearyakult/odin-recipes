    <h2>A Delicious Bundt Cake</h2>

    <p>This sour cream pound cake is always a hit! Sour cream keeps it moist and vanilla adds a lovely flavor. Great for brunch or dust with confectioners sugar and serve with berries for dessert.</p>
    <h1><strong>Ingredients.</strong></h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>375 g all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>656 g white sugar</li>
        <li>227 g unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground mace or 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 cup (250 mL) sour cream</li>
        <li>Icing sugar, as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps.</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C (350 degrees F). Grease and flour a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt or angel food cake pan).</li>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, baking soda, and mace in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Add flour mixture to wet ingredients alternately with sour cream, mixing until just incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan; use the back of a spoon to smooth out the surface of the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 25 minutes. Run a thin knife or offset spatula around the edge of the cake. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
        <li>Dust with powdered sugar before serving.</li>     
    </ol>
